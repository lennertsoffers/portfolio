                        <p>
                            This portfolio website was also a huge undertaking. Around January 2023, I got really
                            interested in WebGL and using the power of Three.js to easily use it. I took the
                            ‘three-js-journey’ course by Bruno Simon, in which I went from someone with a passion for 3d
                            on the web, to someone who was able to create whole 3d experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For my portfolio website, I wanted to defer myself from other developers, and why not
                            broaden the definition of a ‘website’ for this. The real challenge came in trying to write a
                            very custom application, without the use of any Three.js extension libraries. It was really
                            hard for parts like moving the camera or placing objects in the world. I even got a little
                            lower and wrote custom shaders in GLSL to really customize the experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I learned how to set up Typescript without a framework, used WebPack as a development server
                            and bundler and learned a lot about Typescript in general. Also the assets you can see in
                            the website are completely self made in Blender which is another skill I now have.

                            Already since the start of my programming career, I’m very interested in understanding the
                            magic behind the frameworks I use. I especially got interested in Java annotations and how
                            frameworks such as Spring Boot or JPA do with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is when I decided to create a project about annotations and what they can be used for,
                            with a deep dive into annotation processing. In this project, I took a look at the
                            annotation processor of Room, a simple persistence API for Android development. After
                            understanding how this worked, I recreated this from scratch in a library that generates
                            persistence code by just adding specific annotations to your entity models.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was for me one of the most important projects, because I really learned a lot about
                            using frameworks in Java and what exactly they do behind the scenes.

                            During my exchange in Finland, I took a mobile, web and server programming course. For all
                            three of these, we could make an optional project. Since it was allowed to combine the
                            projects of the three courses, it was the perfect opportunity for me to create a larger
                            scale project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created a city builder browser game made with React and Spring Boot secured with JWT.
                            Besides that, I made a mobile application with React Native, where the user could see
                            his/her stats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bringing these three parts together needed the necessary project planning and really
                            maintainable code. The project also has extensive documentation on GitHub.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m really proud that I was able to pull this off and create a full blown browser game. I
                            learned a lot during the planning and development process. The most interesting parts for me
                            were game design principles, React optimization and Spring Security.

                        <p>
                            For the course "PHP Project" we were asked to build a Laravel application of
                            an agenda for people with dementia. The functionalities that were required, were specified
                            by a fictitious customer. First, we had to translate her story into a
                            Use Case Diagram and create a data model from it. After that, we had to do the actual
                            programming of the application in Laravel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was mainly involved in building the agenda itself and the creation, editing and deletion
                            of tasks. The biggest challenge was to do this without a library.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Teamwork was at the heart of this project, which I really experienced as an added value. The
                            team could work very individually, but also help each other out when someone was stuck. I
                            also saw the importance of multiple solutions for certain challenges, where you
                            can decide as a team which is the best.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From this project I learned a lot. We went through the design process of the
                            application, and then we coded it and pitched it for the customer. I try to add value and
                            see opportunities in discussing with others.

                            As the final project of the C# course, we had to create a very basic WPF application. This
                            application had to fetch data from an API, and also use an SQLite database with Dapper as
                            ORM. Furthermore, we needed to use a CI/CD pipeline to publish the application to GitHub.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I took this assignment to the next level by challenging myself with building a game in WPF.
                            PokePlayer was my solution, this is a game that offers the same functionality as the old
                            Pokemon games on the Nintendo DS. I made use of the PokeAPI to fetch various data about the
                            Pokémon's in the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was my first time using an ORM. It’s easy to use, yes, but it brought up the question in
                            me: “How does it work?” This question got answered in a later project of mine.

                            Future 2021. For the assignment, we got the front-end for a Cluedo game. Our goal, finish as
                            many milestones as possible in an afternoon. There were small assignments we had to complete
                            to create the back-end of the Cluedo game.

                            In the Cordova course, we had to create a mobile application as an individual project. The
                            application had to communicate with an API and use some Cordova Plugins. It was the perfect
                            opportunity as I was thinking of creating a planning app as a personal project already.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plennert is an application that allows you to schedule
                            deadlines and set reminders. Categorizing and filtering deadlines was also a
                            priority. Another cool feature was the use of Google’s speech
                            recognition plugin for Cordova, to operate the application with your voice. The backend of
                            Plennert was rather small and created with Spring Boot.

                        <p>
                            Cordova was the first cross-platform mobile technology I used. It was interesting to be able
                            to write code and deploy it to multiple devices.
                        </p>

                            Even while the project wasn’t focussed on it, I learned about dependency management and how
                            to use it. This turned out to be one of the most important skills of developers nowadays.

                            Knowing that the game ‘Minecraft’ is written in Java, I jumped into a little side project
                            with a very basic understanding of the language. It turned out to become maybe my biggest
                            and certainly longest running project so far.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Minecraft in itself is fun, it’s even better to hook your custom features in the game.
                            This is exactly what a plugin does. The goal of my plugin, titled Elemental Stones, is to
                            add a little bit of spice to the game with magical stones. These stones can be used against
                            other players, or just to help yourself out in dangerous situations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I learned an important topic: code maintainability. This I learned the hard
                            way with a lot of rewrites and optimizations. Also testing became significantly harder due
                            to the size. Never user test your own software is a great lesson I will remember forever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With great features comes great documentation… The project became really big, containing
                            lots of features. This also meant that a wiki page for players was necessary. I really
                            focussed on great communication to the player base and supporting them with new updates and
                            bug fixes. Continuously improving the plugin and updating it really paid off in the end, the
                            plugin now has almost 300 downloads on Spigot.mc!

                        <p>
                            In October 2021, I went to Brussels with a team of 5 students to participate in the
                            hackathon organized by Microsoft and Ypto. They challenged us with the following problem:
                            “How can we inventorise the components of a train wagon efficiently, while it is under
                            maintenance?”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We came up with an inventorisation application, with which mechanics can easily scan each
                            component and enter its status (if it needs reparation, replacement…). Since we would also
                            keep track of the circumstances in which components
                            break, we can act preventive on future problems.
                            With this solution we won the main prize of the hackathon, an exclusive tour of the
                            Microsoft headquarters in Paris.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My contribution was brainstorming with the team and
                            creating the preview application to show the audience. The thing I recollect the most is how
                            important it is to give a good and clear presentation. Your solution can be amazing on its
                            own, but being able to convince others of this.

                            During the first year's project week, we were challenged to create 3 AR implementations: a
                            business card for our team, a moving AR model and an AR treasure hunt. While my team
                            focussed on the first two, I created the treasure hunt.

                            an AR experience. I wrote the backend for this treasure hunt in Python Flask. It became an
                            interactive treasure hunt where attention was also paid to the visual aspect. With this
                            solution, we won the project week's AR challenge!

                            tasks, and also tried to divide the work equally.

                            Microsoft and Ypto challenged us with the problem: How to inventorise the components of a
                            wagon. Our solution was an inventorisation application with which you can scan each
                            components
                            its digital tag and than enter the status of the component (if it needs reparation,
                            replacement...).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What set our solution apart from others, is the idea that we would also keep
                            track of the circumstances in which components break down. In this way, we can anticipate
                            the
                            problem by finding a solution for the cause instead of having to replace the component each
                            time. With this solution we won the main prize of the hackathon, an exclusive tour of the
                            Microsoft headquarters in Paris.

                            Elemental Stones is the largest project I have worked on so far. It is a plugin for the game
                            'Minecraft' written in Java. The plugin increases the features that the user has in the game
                            and
                            works server-side. While at school we only saw the basics of Java, during this project I
                            have
                            learned a lot about the programming language and I now understand more complicated concepts.

                        <p>
                            Documentation also plays an important role in the creation of plugins, so I focused on this
                            during the project. I learned working with git and created a dedicated wiki page. I also
                            experienced the power of testing and why other people should test your software too. The
                            plugin
                            now has over 150 downloads on Spigot.mc.

                            For the Cordova course we had to create a mobile application that used an API and some of
                            the
                            Cordova plugins. As a solution I created Plennert. Plennert is a calendar application that
                            allows you to plan future deadlines and be reminded of them. For the first time I used the
                            Google speechrecognition plugin for Cordova which was a very interesting technology to work
                            with. I also wrote a RestAPI in Java Spring to interact with the application.

                            For HTF, we got the front-end for a cluedo game. Our goal, finish as many milestones as
                            possible
                            in an afternoon. There were small assignments we had to complete in Drupal to created the
                            back-end of the cluedo game. It was a challenging experience, but this was certainly the
                            most
                            enjoyable hackathon I participated in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We finished 3 of the 5 milestones and showed that we had
                            an understanding of the use of drupal to speed up repetitive coding work. That's why Warre
                            Hofmans and I won the first place in the Drupal challenge of Hack The Future.
