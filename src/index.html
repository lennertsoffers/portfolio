                            During the first year's project week, we were challenged to create 3 AR implementations: a
                            business
                            card for our team, <span class="highlight">a moving AR model</span> and an AR treasure
                            hunt. While my team focussed on the
                            first
                            two, I created the treasure hunt. For this project we worked together with ZappWorks, a
                            software
                            tool in which you can easily write an application and link it to an AR experience.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">I wrote the
                            backend for this treasure hunt in Python Flask. It became an interactive treasure hunt where
                            attention was also paid to the visual aspect. With this solution, we won the project week's
                            AR
                            challenge!

                            Microsoft and Ypto challenged us with the problem: How to inventorise the components of a
                            wagon. Our solution was an inventorisation application with which you can scan each
                            components
                            its digital tag and than enter the status of the component (if it needs reparation,
                            replacement...).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">
                            What set our solution apart from others, is the idea that we would also keep
                            track of the circumstances in which components break down. In this way, we can anticipate
                            the
                            problem by finding a solution for the cause instead of having to replace the component each
                            time. With this solution we won the main prize of the hackathon, an exclusive tour of the
                            Microsoft headquarters in Paris.

                            Elemental Stones is the largest project I have worked on so far. It is a plugin for the game
                            'Minecraft' written in Java. The plugin increases the features that the user has in the game
                            and
                            works server-side. While at school we only saw the basics of Java, during this project I
                            have
                            learned a lot about the programming language and I now understand more complicated concepts.

                            Documentation also plays an important role in the creation of plugins, so I focused on this
                            during the project. I learned working with git and created a dedicated wiki page. I also
                            experienced the power of testing and why other people should test your software too. The
                            plugin
                            now has over 150 downloads on Spigot.mc.

                            For the Cordova course we had to create a mobile application that used an API and some of
                            the
                            Cordova plugins. As a solution I created Plennert. Plennert is a calendar application that
                            allows you to plan future deadlines and be reminded of them. For the first time I used the
                            Google speechrecognition plugin for Cordova which was a very interesting technology to work
                            with. I also wrote a RestAPI in Java Spring to interact with the application.

                            in an afternoon. There were small assignments we had to complete in Drupal to created the
                            back-end of the cluedo game. It was a challenging experience, but this was certainly the
                            most
                            enjoyable hackathon I participated in.

                            We finished 3 of the 5 milestones and showed that we had
                            an understanding of the use of drupal to speed up repetitive coding work. That's why Warre
                            Hofmans and I won the first place in the Drupal challenge of Hack The Future.
